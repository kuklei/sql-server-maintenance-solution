git pull upstream master && git push origin master

Original work is in 'upstream' (OLA's github). My repo is the 'origin' where I do all the work. 

My repo: https://github.com/kuklei/sql-server-maintenance-solution.git
Ola repo: https://github.com/olahallengren/sql-server-maintenance-solution

The first command pulls from Ola and pushes into min. then you can do a merge from dev git merge --no-ff master
